# this is title1, change at 4 commits.
## this is title2, change at 4 commits.

## this is title2 in second paragraph, change at 4 commits.

###this is the first time i change this file, that means when i commit this reversion it will have 2 commits, change this line at 3commits.

### add this line at 3 commits.

### add this line at 4 commits, and i find that it must be a blank after the symble #.

### so this is the first time i edit in githubDesktop

I keep change something, because I find that there is no change in Changes Tab of githubDesktop.
So I find that Changes Tab embodys the content change which is not be committed. So if I change twice at different time and neither is commited, what will I see. add change at "master" branch.
I keep change, this is the 3rd change without commit // add in 4th, delete a . symble 
<<<<<<< HEAD
I find that githubDesktop embody the content of the last change.

This time I want to test "undo" and "revert to this commit".

new commit and then I regret this version, and revert to the earlier version.
"undo" command button will make the last commit which have not been asychronnized to the Cloud_of_github turn to state of changes. But just the state, the content of file is still there.

I find that githubDesktop embody the content of the last change.
